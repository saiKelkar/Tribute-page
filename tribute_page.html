    <img style = "float: left;" src="leonardo.webp" alt="Leonardo da Vinci" width="400" title="Leonardo da Vinci">
    

    <h2>An Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was 
        active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, 
        theorist, sculptor and an architect.</h2>
    <p>Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class 
        woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the 
        Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his 
        career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of 
        Ludovico Sforza in Milan.</p>
    

    <h3>The following list is a time line of Leonardo's Life:</h3>
    
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>
            1452 - born on April 15.</b><br>
            Leonardo was born to Ser Piero, a notary, and 
            Caterina, a peasant girl; his parents were never married. 
        </li>
        
        
        <li>
            <b>1467 - became an Apprentice to Andrea Del Verrocchio, in Florence.</b><br>
            This date is an estimate, the apprenticeship could have begun a year or two later. But 
            even 1467 would have been a bit late according to the customs of the time: Leonardo would have 
            been fifteen, and most apprentices began at a younger age.
        </li>

        
        <li>
            <b>1469 - Lorenso and Giuliano De Medici Become New Rulers of Florence.</b><br>
            The two brothers took over when their father died. 1469 also marks the birth of 
            Machiavelli, who would be an important advisor to Lorenzo and later write the work of political philosophy
            entitled <em>The Prince</em> (1515).
        </li>

        
        <li>
            <b>1472 - Leonardo becomes a Member of the Florence Painters' Guild. Birth of Copernicus.
            Dante's The Divine Comedy is published.</b><br>
            Other famous painters to join the painters' guild in 11472 were Botticelli and Perugino.
        </li>

        
        <li>
            <b>1473 - Leonardo draws a landscape on the Feast of Santa Maria Delle Neve.</b><br>
            This is his earliest known drawing, though he probably also had a hand in Verrochio's 
            Baptism of Christ, which probably reached completion in or around 1473.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>1475 - Michelangelo Born.</b>

        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>1481 - Leonardo receies a commission to paint The Adoration of The Magi.</b><br>
            The painting was never completed, yet was-and is- considered a masterpiece. This same year,
